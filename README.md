##Why?

I've never made a Mac app and I thought it was a nice idea to learn Swift whilst also making my first Mac app (I am playing with Swift on iOS too, of course).

I also wanted to completely scratch my own itch with this one and make an app to manage all the super handy blog posts, guides, resources, memes etc. out there with all the cool features I could think of. :blush: :stuck_out_tongue:

##What is it?

Basically just a place to keep all your favourite links from [iOS Dev Weekly](https://iosdevweekly.com).

I'm kidding, but mostly yeah. Any link that you want to keep, store it here. I often have a scenario where I'm trying to do something and I remember a post or resource that is relevant to what I was trying to do. I want this app to allow you to find URLs that you've saved in the quickest and easiest way possible.

##How will it allow you to find the URLs?

Well, I'm thinking that I'm going to use both a file system like heirachry/tree that the bookmarks/favourites part of Safari and other [web browsers](http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/conversations-between-browsers-2.jpg) offer, but also use tagging. It's kind of like how you orgainise notes in Evernote I think. You have a notepad to store the notes in, but you can tag notes with any word and find them all in one place.

After that, I'd like the app to pull down the html page and parse it when you search for a URL. This way, if you just remember a phrase from the page you can still find it.

And while I'm keeping the html pages stored for searching, they might as well be viewable too so you can view them offline.

You will obviously be able to store your comments on the URLs too.

##Roadmap?

I don't really think it's that serious, it's just a play thing right now.

##But where else could you go with it?

Lots of ways:

- Companion iOS app for sure
- Safari extension, menu bar button, hotkey or notification centre widget for saving urls
- Safari extension, menu bar button, hotkey or notification centre widget for finding urls
- iOS extension for saving from Safari and other apps
- [Parse](http://parse.com) or something similar to sync between Mac and iOS

##Can I help?

Of course! It would be awesome to learn Mac/Cocoa dev and Swift with someone else. And, to be honest, I'm not sure how much attention I'll pay to this on my own. I'd love to have it. I have piles of iOS Dev Weeklys and tabs open in Safari that I want to save in an organised fasion before I archive/close them, but I'm pretty sure that something else will grab my time.
